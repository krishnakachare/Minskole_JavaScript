/* 
# Lexical Scope: 
   -The scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

# Closure: 
   -A closure is an inner function that has access to its outer function's variables even after the outer function's execution is Completed/Closed.
   -A function that retains access to its lexical scope even when it is executed outside of that lexical scope. e.g. counter
